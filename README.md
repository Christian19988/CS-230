Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a new client of Creative Technology Solutions (CTS). They want to develop a web-based version of their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available only on Android. The game is similar to Win, Lose, or Draw, where teams guess the puzzle being drawn. However, in this digital version, images are rendered from a library of stock drawings as clues, and each game consists of four rounds lasting one minute each.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing the documentation, I focused on clearly defining the client's requirements, including functionality, platform compatibility, and gameplay mechanics. I also provided a structured outline detailing the components of the software design, ensuring clarity and coherence.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Developing the design document helped in structuring the software architecture and defining the interactions between different components. It provided a roadmap for the development process, guiding the implementation phase and ensuring alignment with the client's needs.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise a part of the document, I would focus on providing more detailed descriptions of the user interface and user experience aspects. Enhancing these sections would improve the clarity and comprehensiveness of the design document, ensuring that the development team has a clear understanding of the expected user interactions and interface elements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To implement the user's needs into the software design, I conducted thorough discussions with the client to understand their requirements and preferences. It's crucial to consider the user's needs during the design phase because ultimately, the success of the software depends on its usability and alignment with user expectations.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

In designing software, I employed techniques such as requirement analysis, use case modeling, and prototyping to understand the problem domain and devise effective solutions. To analyze and design similar software applications in the future, I would continue to emphasize collaboration and adherence to best practices in software engineering. Additionally, leveraging agile methods would facilitate adaptability to changing requirements and iterative improvement of the software product.
